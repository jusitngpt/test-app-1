- Design solutions that help customers make progress

### Key Questions:
1. What job is the customer hiring this process to do?
2. What are the circumstances of the struggle?
3. What are the functional, emotional, and social dimensions?
4. What does success look like for the customer?

## Workflow Automation Layers

### 1. Information Synthesis
- Gathering data from multiple sources
- Summarizing and extracting insights
- Creating reports and documentation

### 2. Process Execution
- Following defined workflows
- Making rule-based decisions
- Routing tasks and notifications

### 3. Cognitive Tasks
- Pattern recognition
- Predictive analysis
- Natural language understanding

### 4. Human-AI Collaboration
- AI assists, human decides
- AI drafts, human reviews
- AI monitors, human intervenes

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
- Process documentation
- Data preparation
- Team alignment
- Pilot selection

### Phase 2: Pilot (Months 3-4)
- Build MVP automation
- Test with small group
- Measure results
- Gather feedback

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 5-6)
